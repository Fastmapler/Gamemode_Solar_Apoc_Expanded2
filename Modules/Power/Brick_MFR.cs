//The Modular Fission Reactor, the ultimate solution for power.
//Other names include: My Fantastic Reactor, Mega Flippin' Reactor, etc.

////Brick parts
//MFR Hull: Baseplate for the MFR. Build using "Construction" themed materials (ie Adamantine, Steel, Lead)
//MFR Reaction Chamber: Stackable space upgrades for the MFR. More of these means more slots for parts. Build using "Modifier" themed materials (ie Naturum, Plastic, Rubber)
//MFR Port: Placed alongside the MFR hull for various I/O
//      --Fuel - I/O for fissile fuels. More of these means more max fuel capacity
//      --Coolant - I/O for coolants. More of these means more max coolant capacity.
//      --Breeder - Takes in specific materials and uses the bombardment of isotopes (based on nuclear waste production rate) to make superior fissile fuels. Each breeder functions independantly.
//MFR Control Panel: Main control station for a MFR. Build using "Electrical" themed materials (ie Energium, Teflon, Dielectrics). Requries power.
