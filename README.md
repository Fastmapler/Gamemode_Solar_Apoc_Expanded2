Make weapon ammo drop on death

Rare and common drops from bosses

Machine energy I/O statistic monitoring

Two alternate bosses

Random events (Solar flares, trading caravans, etc.)

Auto-drills (Placable drill to automatically mine materials)

Drones (Mining, Combat)

Alchemical Transmutation Fusion Reactor (ATFR)
